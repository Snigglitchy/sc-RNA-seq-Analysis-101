# 🧬 sc-RNA Analysis for Noobs 😵‍💫  
**Because single-cell RNA analysis is hard enough without the added confusion.**  

## Welcome, Fellow Noob!  
New to R? New to single-cell RNA sequencing? Do you stare at your dataset like it **personally offended you**? **You’re not alone!**  

This repo is here to **hold your hand, wipe your tears, and guide you through the madness** of scRNA-seq analysis—without making you feel like you need a PhD *just* to get started (even if you’re doing a PhD).  

---

## How to Use  
1. **Clone this repo** (or download it if Git scares you)  
2. **Install required R packages** (instructions inside 📂 `setup_instructions.md`)  
3. **Follow the scripts step by step** in 📂 `notebooks/`  
4. **Feel like a single-cell data analysis wizard** (or at least fake it convincingly)

## Prerequisites  
Make sure you have:  
- **R & RStudio** installed  
- Some familiarity with **basic R commands** (don’t worry, I’ll guide you!)  
- A **sense of humor** for when things inevitably break

## Help! It’s Not Working!  
- **Check the error message. Google it. Stack Overflow is your bestie.**  
- **Read the comments in my scripts.** I promise I tried to warn you about the pitfalls.  
- **If all else fails, open an issue!** I may not be a genius, but I’ve probably made the same mistake.

## Sniggie's Final Words  
Take a deep breath. **You got this.** scRNA analysis feels like chaos at first, but trust me—it *does* get better. And when in doubt, just blame batch effects. 😉  

*Now go forth and analyze like a pro!*
