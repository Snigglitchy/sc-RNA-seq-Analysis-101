# 🧬 sc-RNA Analysis for Noobs 😵‍💫  
**Because single-cell RNA analysis is hard enough without the added confusion.**  

## 🎉 Welcome, Fellow Noob!  
New to R? New to single-cell RNA sequencing? Do you stare at your dataset like it **personally offended you**? **You’re not alone!**  

This repo is here to **hold your hand, wipe your tears, and guide you through the madness** of scRNA-seq analysis—without making you feel like you need a PhD *just* to get started (even if you’re doing a PhD).

## 🔥 What’s in This Repo?  
✅ **Beginner-friendly R scripts** (with actual explanations, because you deserve better)  
✅ **Step-by-step workflow** for processing, analyzing, and visualizing scRNA data  
✅ **Common errors + troubleshooting** (because R loves drama)  
✅ **Meme energy** to keep you going when your PCA plot looks like modern art
