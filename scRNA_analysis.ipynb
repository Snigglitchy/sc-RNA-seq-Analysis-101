# R and RStudio Basics for scRNA-seq Data Analysis

# Welcome to this R and RStudio basics guide for absolute beginners! 
# This notebook will help you get started with the basics of R so that you can eventually analyze scRNA-seq data.

# 1. üìò Why Learn R?
# R is a programming language used for statistical computing and data analysis, especially in bioinformatics.
# It will help us analyze gene expression data from single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq).

# 2. üñ•Ô∏è What is RStudio?
# RStudio is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that makes it easier to write and run R code.
# It contains:
# - Console: where you type and run commands.
# - Script Editor: where you write and save your R code.
# - Environment: displays active variables and datasets.
# - Files/Plots/Help/Viewer: access files, view plots, and more.

# 3. üî¢ Basic Concepts in R

# Let's dive into some basic concepts such as variables, vectors, and operators. We'll start simple and build up.

# **Variables** in R are used to store data. You can think of them like containers where you store numbers, text, or other information.

# Assign a number to a variable
my_number <- 10

# Assign a text string to a variable
my_text <- "Hello, R!"

# Print the values of these variables
print(my_number)  # This will print: 10
print(my_text)    # This will print: Hello, R!

# Explanation of the code above:
# - `my_number <- 10`: The `<-` is the assignment operator. It stores the value on the right (10) into the variable on the left (my_number).
# - `print()`: This function displays the value of the variable inside the parentheses. In this case, `print(my_number)` will show `10`.

# **Vectors** are one of the most commonly used data structures in R. A vector is an ordered collection of elements that are all of the same type.

# Create a numeric vector
my_vector <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

# Create a character vector
my_char_vector <- c("apple", "banana", "cherry")

# Print the vectors
print(my_vector)       # This will print: [1] 1 2 3 4 5
print(my_char_vector)  # This will print: [1] "apple" "banana" "cherry"

# Explanation of the code:
# - `c()` is the combine function, which allows you to combine individual values into a vector. 
# - `my_vector <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)` creates a vector with 5 numbers.
# - Similarly, `my_char_vector <- c("apple", "banana", "cherry")` creates a character vector with 3 items.

# 4. üìä Importing Data into R

# Often, we'll need to import data into R for analysis. Let's learn how to import data stored in CSV files using the `read.csv()` function.

# Import data from a CSV file
data <- read.csv("path_to_your_file.csv")

# View the first few rows of the dataset
head(data)

# Explanation:
# - `read.csv()` is a function that reads a CSV file and stores it in a variable. Replace `"path_to_your_file.csv"` with your actual file path.
# - `head()` is used to display the first 6 rows of the dataset, which is helpful for quickly checking your data.

# 5. üîç Subsetting Data

# Sometimes, you don‚Äôt need the entire dataset but only specific rows or columns. Subsetting allows you to select parts of the data based on certain conditions.

# Subset data to get rows where the 'Gene' column is equal to "GeneX"
subset_data <- subset(data, Gene == "GeneX")

# View the subset data
head(subset_data)

# Explanation:
# - `subset()` is a function used to extract rows from a dataset based on a condition. In this case, it selects rows where the `Gene` column has the value `"GeneX"`.
# - `==` is a logical operator that checks if two values are equal.

# 6. üìä Plotting Data

# Visualizing data is crucial in data analysis. In R, you can use libraries like `ggplot2` to create various types of plots. Let's start by creating a simple scatter plot.

# Install ggplot2 (you only need to install it once)
install.packages("ggplot2")

# Load the ggplot2 package
library(ggplot2)

# Create a scatter plot of Gene vs. Expression
ggplot(data, aes(x = Gene, y = Expression)) +
  geom_point()

# Explanation:
# - `install.packages("ggplot2")`: Installs the ggplot2 package, which is used for making plots. This step only needs to be done once.
# - `library(ggplot2)`: Loads the ggplot2 package into your R session.
# - `ggplot()`: This function creates the plot. The `aes(x = Gene, y = Expression)` inside the function tells ggplot2 to plot `Gene` on the x-axis and `Expression` on the y-axis.
# - `geom_point()`: This adds the actual points (scatter plot) to the graph.

# 7.  What's Next?

# Now that you know the basics of R, you are ready to start working with more complex scRNA-seq data. Here's what we'll learn next:
# - Data cleaning and preparation for scRNA-seq analysis.
# - Dimensionality reduction methods such as PCA and UMAP.
# - Clustering cells based on gene expression patterns.
# - Visualizing your scRNA-seq data and results.

# Stay tuned, and happy coding! üåü
