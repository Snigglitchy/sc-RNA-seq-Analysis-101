# R and RStudio Basics for scRNA-seq Data Analysis

## Welcome to this R and RStudio Basics Guide for Absolute Beginners!

In this notebook, we'll start from the very basics of R and work towards using R for scRNA-seq analysis. 

Weâ€™ll cover:

1. Assigning values to variables
2. Creating vectors
3. Importing data
4. Subsetting data
5. Plotting data

## Why Learn R?

R is a powerful programming language used for statistical computing and data analysis, especially for bioinformatics and genomics. We will use R to analyze gene expression data from single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq).

## What is RStudio?

RStudio is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for R. It provides a user-friendly interface to help you write and execute R code.

### Key RStudio Components:
- **Console**: Where you type and run R commands.
- **Script Editor**: For writing and saving your R code.
- **Environment**: Displays your active variables and datasets.
- **Files/Plots/Help/Viewer**: Access files, generate plots, and read help documentation.

## Basic Concepts in R

### 1. Variables

In R, variables store values such as numbers or text.

```r
# Assigning a number to a variable
my_number <- 10

# Assigning a string (text) to a variable
my_text <- "Hello, R!"

# Print the values of these variables
print(my_number) # Output: 10
print(my_text)   # Output: Hello, R!
```
