    "# Introduction to R and RStudio for scRNA-seq Analysis FOR NOOBS\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome Noobs, we will learn about R and RStudio! This notebook is designed for absolute beginners who want to learn R in the context of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis. By the end of this notebook, you'll be familiar with the basics of R, including functions, operators, and data structures, which will help you analyze scRNA-seq data in the future.\n",
