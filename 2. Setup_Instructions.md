# ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions: Getting Started with sc-RNA Analysis  

Welcome to **sc-RNA Analysis for Noobs!** Before you dive in, let‚Äôs get your system set up properly so you don‚Äôt have to fight with R right out of the gate.  

---

##  Step 1: Install R & RStudio  
If you haven‚Äôt already, install:  
- **[R](https://cran.r-project.org/)** (the programming language)  
- **[RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)** (a much friendlier interface for R)  

Make sure you have the latest versions!  

---

##  Step 2: Install Required Packages  
Open RStudio and run the following command to install all necessary packages:  

```r
install.packages(c("Seurat", "ggplot2", "dplyr", "patchwork", "SingleCellExperiment"))
```

If you need Bioconductor packages, install them like this:  

```r
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE)) install.packages("BiocManager")
BiocManager::install(c("scater", "scran"))
```

If any package refuses to install, **Google the error message.** It's usually something silly.  

---

**Install Jupyter Notebook**:
   - Install **Jupyter Notebook** via **Anaconda** or using **pip**.
     - If you're using **Anaconda**, you can install it with the following command:
       ```bash
       conda install -c conda-forge jupyterlab
       ```
     - Alternatively, if you're using **pip**, run:
       ```bash
       pip install notebook
       ```

## Install R Kernel for Jupyter

To run R code in Jupyter Notebook, you need to install the **R kernel**. This allows Jupyter to recognize and run R code blocks.

### Steps to Install R Kernel:

1. **Open RStudio**:
   - Start RStudio and open the **R console**.

2. **Install the IRkernel Package**:
   - In the R console, install the `IRkernel` package by running the following command:
     ```r
     install.packages("IRkernel")
     ```

3. **Install the Jupyter Kernel**:
   - After installing the `IRkernel` package, run the following command to make the R kernel available in Jupyter:
     ```r
     IRkernel::installspec(user = FALSE)
     ```

   This command makes the R kernel available to Jupyter, allowing you to run R code in Jupyter notebooks.

---

## Running the Notebooks

After setting up the R kernel for Jupyter, you can now open and run R notebooks in Jupyter.

### Option 1: Running Notebooks in Jupyter

1. **Open Jupyter Notebook**:
   - Run Jupyter by typing `jupyter notebook` in your terminal or Anaconda prompt.

2. **Create a New Notebook**:
   - In the Jupyter interface, click on **New** and select **R** as the kernel.

3. **Run the Notebook**:
   - Open any R-based notebook (`.ipynb` file) in the Jupyter interface, and you can start running the code interactively.

---

### Option 2: Running Notebooks in RStudio

If you prefer to run the notebook in **RStudio**, you can convert the Jupyter notebook into an **R Markdown** file (`.Rmd`):

1. **Convert the Jupyter Notebook to R Markdown**:
   - After writing your notebook in Jupyter, you can convert it to an R Markdown file using the following command in your terminal:
     ```bash
     jupyter nbconvert --to markdown --template rmarkdown your_notebook.ipynb
     ```

   Alternatively, you can manually copy and paste the content into an `.Rmd` file.

2. **Open the R Markdown File in RStudio**:
   - Open the converted `.Rmd` file in **RStudio**.
   - You can run the code chunks interactively in RStudio.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **If you can‚Äôt find the R kernel in Jupyter**: Ensure you have installed the `IRkernel` package correctly and that Jupyter can access the R kernel.
  
- **If Jupyter or RStudio is not opening**: Make sure you have installed the necessary software (Jupyter, R, RStudio) and that you have followed all installation steps correctly.

---

##  Step 3: Clone or Download This Repository  
If you're comfortable with Git, clone this repo:  

```sh
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/sc-RNA-Analysis-for-Noobs.git
cd sc-RNA-Analysis-for-Noobs
```

If Git scares you, just click **"Download ZIP"** from the GitHub page and extract it.  

---

##  Step 4: Open the R Project  
- In RStudio, go to **File ‚Üí Open Project**  
- Select `sc-RNA-Analysis-for-Noobs.Rproj`  

This makes your life easier by setting up the right working directory.  

---

##  Step 5: Test Your Setup  
Run this in RStudio to check if everything is working:  

```r
library(Seurat)
library(ggplot2)
print("Setup successful! üéâ")
```

If you see `"Setup successful! üéâ"`, congrats! You‚Äôre ready to roll.  

---

## Troubleshooting  
**Issue:** *Package won‚Äôt install?*  
Try restarting RStudio and running the install command again.  
If it says *"dependency XYZ is missing"*, install that package first using `install.packages("XYZ")`.  
If you're on Windows, R might need **RTools** (install it from [here](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/)).

## You're All Set! LEZZGOOOOOOO 
Now, head over to **notebooks/** and start running the analysis scripts!
